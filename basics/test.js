const accountid = 1234567
let accountname = "khyatic" // let is same as var i.e stores variable value. This is used to avoid the problem of scope
var accountpass= "12547" // avoid using var keyword becuase of issue in block scope and functional scope
accountcity = "shahada"

accountstate= "bihar"
// accountid= 234

// let accountpass; // this is not allowed in js value must be passed 
 console.log(accountname)

console.table([accountid,accountcity,accountname,accountpass]) //this is another method to print
